Sometimes we may fall into the pattern of living our lives according to doctrine for which we don't truly know the source.  This is always a good theme for meaningful scripture study and prayer.

### Word of Wisdom

What is it?
- a law?
- a recommendation?
- what was the context at the time it was given?
- how is/should it observed today?
- what is the doctrine behind the Word of Wisdom?
- what are the principles?
- has our area, stake or ward provided any rules/programs to help us implement the principles we have been taught?

I know that some say the revelations upon these points are not given by way of commandment. Very well, but we are commanded to observe every word that proceeds from the mouth of God (DBY, 182–83).

The Spirit whispers to me to call upon the Latter-day Saints to observe the Word of Wisdom, to let tea, coffee, and tobacco alone, and to abstain from drinking spirituous drinks. This is what the Spirit signifies through me. If the Spirit of God whispers this to his people through their leader, and they will not listen nor obey, what will be the consequences of their disobedience? Darkness and blindness of mind with regard to the things of God will be their lot; they will cease to have the spirit of prayer, and the spirit of the world will increase in them in proportion to their disobedience until they apostatize entirely from God and his ways (DBY, 183).

The constitution that a person has should be nourished and cherished; and whenever we take anything into the system to force and stimulate it beyond its natural capacity, it shortens life. I am physician enough to know that. … If you will follow this counsel, you will be full of life and health, and you will increase your intelligence, your joy, and comfort (DBY, 183).
